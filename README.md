1. Goals of the Project
The primary goal of this project is to promote sustainability by connecting users' finances to an app that calculates their carbon footprint based on their spending habits. The app will also provide personalized recommendations on how to reduce their carbon footprint through AI-driven insights, using the OpenAI API.

2. Desired User Experience
The user will connect their bank account to the app's interface, which will then extract information about their spending habits. Based on this data, the app will display the carbon emissions associated with various expenses such as gas station visits, shopping, electricity, and more.

The app will provide the following features:

Display the total amount spent and compare it to the average.
Show the carbon footprint emitted and compare it to the previous month.
Present data through pop-ups, widgets, graphs, and charts with relevant information.
Offer a visually appealing interface with complex gradients, formal chic style, and smooth animations.
Generate AI-driven recommendations, using the OpenAI API, to suggest areas where the user can decrease their carbon footprint.
3. Implementation Details
To achieve these goals, we plan to:

Integrate the Plaid API to securely connect and extract user's bank information.
Implement a carbon footprint calculation model based on the user's spending data.
Develop an AI-driven recommendation engine, utilizing the OpenAI API, to suggest ways to reduce the carbon footprint.
Design a visually appealing and user-friendly interface with responsive components.
Add modal windows for displaying graphs and charts with relevant data.
Implement smooth animations for an engaging user experience.
4. Issues Encountered, Bugs Fixed or Still Present, and Future Work to be Done
During the development of the project, we have faced the following challenges:

Connecting Plaid API: We experienced difficulties in integrating the Plaid API to extract user's bank information securely. This issue has been resolved through extensive testing and collaboration with Plaid's support team.
Modal Implementation: We encountered challenges in implementing the modal windows to display graphs and charts effectively. This issue has been partially resolved, but further improvements are required for a smoother user experience.
Complex Styling: Designing the interface with complex gradients and formal chic style proved to be challenging. While we have achieved some of the desired design elements, additional work is needed to refine the overall look and feel of the app.
Animation Functionality: Implementing smooth animations for an engaging user experience has been challenging. Some animations have been successfully implemented, but further work is needed to ensure consistent performance across all components.
OpenAI API Integration: Integrating the OpenAI API to generate AI-driven recommendations has been successfully implemented, but ongoing improvements and refinements are necessary to provide more accurate and relevant suggestions.
Moving forward, we plan to:

Improve the modal window implementation for a better user experience.
Continue refining the interface design to achieve the desired formal chic style.
Enhance the animation functionality for a smoother and more engaging experience.
Expand the AI-driven recommendation engine, powered by the OpenAI API, to include more personalized and actionable suggestions for reducing carbon footprint.
Continuously refine the OpenAI API integration to improve the accuracy and relevance of the generated recommendations.
